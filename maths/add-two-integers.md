➕ Problem - Add Two Integers (Java)

  🌟 The Problem
  We are given two integers and need to return their sum.
  It's a very simple task, but it's good reminder that clean and readable code is always the goal, no matter how small the problem is.

  💡 What I Did
  I creates a small method called sum that takes two intergers as parameters.
  It adds them together, stores the result in a variable, and ther returns that value.
  Just one clear line that does exactly what's needes - nothing more.

  📘 What I Learned
  - How to define a basic method with parameters and a reurn type
  How even the simplest problems can be chance to practice good habits
  the importance of keeping code short, clea, and easy to undrestad
