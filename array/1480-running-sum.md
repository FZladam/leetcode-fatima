# 🧮 Problem 1480 - Running Sum of 1D Array (Java)

## 🧩 The problem
Transform an array into  a "running sum" - where each element becomes the sum of all the elements that comme before it, plus itself.

## 🧠 What i did
I simply looped throught the array.
At each step, I added the previous tatal to the current value.
No need to create a new array - I just updated the original one directly.

- ## 🚀 What i learned
- How to use loops to gradully apdate array values
- How to save memory by working directly with the same arrays

## 📄 Code 
See '1480-running-sum.java' in this folder.
